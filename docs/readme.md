*    Game Dev Book Code
*    (C) David Cramer 2023
*	
*	This is code being written in the course of working
*	through SDL Game Development and commits will
* 	reflect as such until fully worked through building
* 	the framework for a full 2d game. Said framework 
*	will be based on this book but heavily modified and
*	used only as the foundation of this software.
*	As much as possible code will be rewritten, removed,
*	and refactored so as to avoid copyright issues with 
* 	the published code. 
*
*	Any and all copyright concerns should be brought,
*	as soon as practicable, directly to: 
*	David@erraticsoft.com so they can be addressed 
*	in good faith.

## Notes:
There is a massive bug somethere that I *** cannot *** figure out so I'm pausing this and using a new resource.

I will revisit this after a bit of a brush up on general concepts and general skill improvment.
